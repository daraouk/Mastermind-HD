Sound Effects Directory
=======================

Place sound effect files here. See /SOUNDS_NEEDED.md for complete list.

Required files (MP3 format recommended):
- tap.mp3
- select.mp3
- button.mp3
- place.mp3
- hint.mp3
- correct.mp3
- wrong.mp3
- complete.mp3
- win.mp3
- lose.mp3
- star.mp3
- unlock.mp3
- whoosh.mp3
- tick.mp3

The game will work without these files (silent mode).
Add sounds incrementally during testing.
